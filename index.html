<h1 id="part-1.-defining-correspondences">Part 1. Defining
Correspondences</h1>
<p>Our goal is to morph the shapes of two images together. To do this we
first need to select corresponding keypoints for each image. To make a
2d warp we can use a triangular mesh that covers the whole image, using
keypoints such that the triangles in each image correspond to each
other. A good method for getting more evenly sized triangles is to use
Delaunay triangulation to produce the triangular mesh.</p>
<p><img src="im1.png" alt="image" /></p>
<h1 id="part-2.-computing-the-mid-way-face">Part 2. Computing the
“Mid-Way Face”</h1>
<p>We must figure out how to get from one triangle to the corresponding
triangle in the transformed image. We can set up a system of linear
equations to solve for the transformation matrix.</p>
<p>Given a triangle T <span
class="math inline">(<em>a</em><sub><em>x</em></sub>,<em>a</em><sub><em>y</em></sub>)</span>,
<span
class="math inline">(<em>b</em><sub><em>x</em></sub>,<em>b</em><sub><em>y</em></sub>)</span>,
and <span
class="math inline">(<em>c</em><sub><em>x</em></sub>,<em>c</em><sub><em>y</em></sub>)</span>
and a triangle T’ with vertices <span
class="math inline">(<em>a</em><sub><em>x</em></sub>′,<em>a</em><sub><em>y</em></sub>′)</span>,
<span
class="math inline">(<em>b</em><sub><em>x</em></sub>′,<em>b</em><sub><em>y</em></sub>′)</span>,
and <span
class="math inline">(<em>c</em><sub><em>x</em></sub>′,<em>c</em><sub><em>y</em></sub>′)</span>
we can set up a system of linear equations that describes this affine
warp.</p>
<p><img src="im2.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p><img src="im3.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>We can solve this for A =<br />
Using this method, we can warp each triangle in the average mesh into
the corresponding triangle in the original image’s mesh. This tells us
which positions in the original image would warp to each pixel of the
midway image, and I used linear barycentric interpolation interpolation
to get the color for that pixel.</p>
<p>We do this for both of the original face images to get the average
shape. To get the average color we average the pixel values and then we
have our mid-way face.</p>
<p><img src="im4.png" alt="image" /></p>
<h1 id="part-3.-the-morph-sequence">Part 3. The Morph Sequence</h1>
<p>To get each frame of the morph sequence, we perform the same
procedure used for generating the mid-way face, but we use a weighted
average instead.</p>

<h1 id="part-4.-the-mean-face-of-a-population">Part 4. The “Mean Face”
of a Population</h1>
<p>Using The FEI face database (Brazilian face database) dataset, we can
compute the average face of this population by calculating the average
face shape and morphing each face into the average shape. I did not
divide into subpopulations such as gender. Below are some examples of
images from the dataset morphed into the average shape for the entire
dataset.</p>

<h1 id="part-5.-caricatures-extrapolating-from-the-mean">Part 5.
Caricatures: Extrapolating from the Mean</h1>
<p>Let’s consider the average face shape to be a vector h and my face
shape to be a vector f, then f<span class="math inline">−</span>h can be
interpreted as what is unique about my face and we can extrapolate my
face further in those directions. Therefore, by adding <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em></span>(f<span
class="math inline">−</span>h) to my face shape (where <span
class="math inline"><em>α</em>&gt;</span>0) and morphing my face into
the new shape, we can exaggerate my facial features to provide a
caricature of myself.</p>
<p>Below are the results for extrapolating from the mean of the entire
FEI face database, including males and females.</p>
<figure>

alt="Left is my normal face. Right is my face warped onto my unique features with \alpha=0.5." />

warped onto my unique features with <span

<h1 id="bells-and-whistles-change-gender">Bells and Whistles: Change
Gender</h1>
<p>Out of curiosity, I projected my face onto the the average shape of
Japanese actresses. I also adjusted what the weights accordingly. My
correspondence points should have been a little different because it
makes my chin really disproportionate. Other than that, I do look
better.</p>
